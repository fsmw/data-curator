\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

Visualization authors often create visualizations iteratively, alternating between data transformation and visualization steps. This process requires proficiency with tools and considerable effort to manage various versions of data and charts. 
Although AI-powered tools aim to reduce user effort, they fall short for iterative analysis, expecting users to specify their intent at once with NL inputs.
We present \df, an interactive system for iterative visualization authoring. \df features a multi-modal UI that allows users to specify visualizations using a blend of UI and NL inputs, enabling users to convey complex designs more precisely without verbose prompts.
To help user manage iteration directions, \df introduces data threads for users to navigate, branch, and reuse previous designs. In a user study with eight participants reproducing two challenging data exploration sessions consisting of 16 visualizations, we observed that \df enabled participants to develop their own iteration and verification strategies confidently with minimal hints.
