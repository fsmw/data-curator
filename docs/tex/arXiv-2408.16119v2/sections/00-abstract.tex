Data analysts often need to iterate between data transformations and chart designs to create rich visualizations for exploratory data analysis. Although many AI-powered systems have been introduced to reduce the effort of visualization authoring, existing systems are not well suited for iterative authoring. They typically require analysts to provide, in a single turn, a text-only prompt that fully describe a complex visualization. 
We introduce \tool (\df for short), an AI-powered visualization system designed to overcome this limitation.
\df blends graphical user interfaces and natural language inputs to enable users to convey their intent more effectively, while delegating data transformation to AI.
Furthermore, to support efficient iteration, \df lets users navigate their iteration history and reuse previous designs, eliminating the need to start from scratch each time. 
A user study with eight participants demonstrated that \df allowed participants to develop their own iteration styles to complete challenging data exploration sessions.
