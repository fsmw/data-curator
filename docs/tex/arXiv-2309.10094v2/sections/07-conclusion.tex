\section{Conclusion} This paper introduces Data Formulator, a concept-driven visualization authoring tool that leverages an AI agent to address the data transformation challenge in visualization authoring. With Data Formulator, authors work with the AI agent to create new data concepts and then map data concepts to visual channels to specify visualizations. Data Formulator then automatically transforms the input data and instantiates the visualizations. Throughout the authoring process, Data Formulator provides feedback to the authors to inspect and refine the generated code to promote confidence. As discovered in the chart reproduction study, participants can learn and use Data Formulator to create visualizations that require advanced data transformations. In the future, the concept-driven visualization approach can potentially benefit the design of new visual data exploration tools and expressive visualization authoring tools to overcome the data transformation barrier.
